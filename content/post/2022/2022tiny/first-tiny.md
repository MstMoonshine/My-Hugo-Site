**This is the first tiny post on the blog!**

## Why tiny post?

Because a lot of cool ideas are worth to be recorded, but I do not have the time or energy to write long posts on all of them. Having a high threshold for expectations in the length of the posts makes me less interested in writing them down. So here it is! Now in tiny posts I do not have to care about post lengths or topics at all.

## Why not Twitter, or Mastodon, or ...?

In 2022, I do not really take Twitter as a good platform to share knowledge. It's more like a wasted ruin, with rumors and emotional quibbles being pervasive in it. Besides, it has a strict length limit under which you can hardly describe a nontrivial idea with clarity. To get rid of it, I am now using [Mailbrew](https://mailbrew.com/) to subscribe to important people (to me) only on Twitter.

Mastodon is a good alternative. I am now one of the members of [mathstodon](https://mathstodon.xyz/home), which focuses on maths. Discussions on it are more serious, interesting, and professional. Nevertheless, this also narrows down the topics I would like to talk about on the platform, unlike in here, a space of my own, where I can freely choose any topic without a boundary.
