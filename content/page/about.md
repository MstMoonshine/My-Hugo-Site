Welcome to MstMoonshine's Blog!

I am currently a PhD student majoring in computer science at the University of Hong Kong.
My research interests include but are not restricted to system security,
trusted execution environment, side-channel attacks, etc.

I got my bachelor degree from Department of Physics at Southern University of Science
and Technology. The physics training endows me with the capability of reasoning
everything from the very beginning, which I now enjoy a lot. Since to become a hacker
has always been my dream, I changed my career track after graduation. So now I
am a hacker who knows quantum mechanics üòù.
